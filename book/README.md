Introduction
============

MapDB is an open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed), embedded Java database engine and collection framework. It provides Maps, Sets, Lists, Queues, Bitmaps with range queries, expiration, compression, off-heap storage and streaming. MapDB is probably the fastest Java database, with performance comparable to `java.util` collections. It also provides advanced features such as ACID transactions, snapshots, incremental backups and much more.

This manual is a work-in-progress and it will be completed together with the MapDB 3.0 release. We hope you will find it useful. If you'd like to contribute to MapDB, we would be very happy to accept [pull requests](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb-site/tree/gh-pages)

Code examples from this manual [are in github repository](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb-site/tree/gh-pages/src/test/java/doc)
