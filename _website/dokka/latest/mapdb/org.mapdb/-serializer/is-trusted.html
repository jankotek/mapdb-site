<p><p> MapDB has relax record size boundary checking. It expect deserializer to read exactly as many bytes as were writen during serialization. If deserializer reads more bytes it might start reading others record data in store. </p>
<p> Some serializers (Kryo) have problems with this. To prevent this we can not read data directly from store, but must copy them into separate <code>byte[]</code>. So zero copy optimalizations is disabled by default, and must be explicitly enabled here. </p>
<p> This flag indicates if this serializer was 'verified' to read as many bytes as it writes. It should be also much better tested etc. </p>
 </p>
<strong>Return</strong><br/>
true if this serializer is well tested and writes as many bytes as it reads.<br/>
