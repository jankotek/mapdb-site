title: Lessons from MapDB development

MapDB is great project, but for many reasons it is falling behind other projects 
which raised around the same time (Hazelcast, Redis...). 
In this post I will outline mistakes I made over the years, while working on MapDB. 

- concurrency
    - JDMB3 back in 2012 used single `ReadWriteLock` to handle concurrency. 
        - That allows parallel readers, but single writer. 
        - SQLite has similar approach
        - Antirez from Redis is a big advocate of simplifying things by avoiding concurrency  
    - That was redesigned in MapDB 1, to allow parallel writers
    - Parallel writers did not brought real performance benefits
        - `j.u.c.ConcurrentSkipListMap` scales linearly with number of cores 
        - MapDB only scales up to 4 cores
    - Concurrency greatly complicated things and is responsible for many delays
    - Most benefits for concurrency could be achieved under single lock
        - Fail fast iterator in JDBM3 would throw `ConcurrentModificationException`, that can be fixed under single lock
        - Concurrent scalability is still possible under single lock with sharding and other trivial tricks
        - Single lock would still allow background writer thread, main benefit for a latency
        
- writing database is hard task
    - working over raw binary files is thought
        - good luck debuging wrong file offset at 1TB stores    
    - even now in 2017, there are not many database engines
        - most of them use relatively simple ideas (BTree, LSM)
    - papers describe logarithms are often impresise
        - there is B-Link-Tree paper which describes concurrent BTree
            - published in 1980ties, many citations
            - but even today it is not clear howto handle some concurrent cases (root update)
            - initial implementation took one week
            - it took about 3 months of work to nail it and make it thread safe
    
- too many features
    - MapDB had too many ways to open files, handle concurrency,
    - that created too many combinations to test 
    - it was hard to document and explain all the features

- code duplication and not invented here
    - I spend long time written code, which was already written in other libraries
    - MapBD was self contained, with no dependencies
   
- MapDB does not integrate with default tools and defacto standards
    - TFile and HFile and other formats
        - data exported from MapDB could be used by other databases 
        - mapdb could operate directly over data created by other tools
    - other file formats
    - reimplementation of existing API (LevelDB java binding)
        - this way MapDB could be used as a drop-in replacement for other libraries
    
- did not follow test driven development
    - automated testing in MapDB is still fairly good, for example we test process crash recovery with  `killl -9 PID`
    - we had the same problem with JDBM 1.5 back in 2008
    - long running tests were broken for a long time (fixed now)
    - it took too long to run default unit tests (fixed now)
    
- not enough performance testing
    - no performance regression testing
    - Single Entry locks destroyed performance in 3.x branch (fixed in 3.0.5)
    - old code had concurrent scalability problems
        - it used segmented locks
        - too many embedded locks, sometimes semaphores without memory barrier would do
   
- file format and API had changed way too many times 
    - it was necessary to fix early design mistakes 
    - should have started with in-memory store
    - code change is sometimes necessary
    
- documentation
    - spend way too much time deciding on format (Markdown versus Restructured) 
    - too much time went into generating PDFs, not many people are using it 
    - mapdb.org was originally generated by Maven Site plugin (haha)
    - github wiki would be fine from start
    - MapDB needs way more code examples
