title: MapDB 4 and near future
layout: comments
tags: [Roadmap, 4.0]
---

I decided to start new major MapDB version. Master branch was already refactored and tagged as MapDB 4.


## MapDB 3
 
* [MapDB3 was announced](http://www.mapdb.org/blog/mapdb3/)  more than 18 months ago. 
* Current stable branch is 3.0. 
* Dev branch 3.1 is cancelled 
    * I started backporting changes to 3.0.x releases; 
    * for example 3.0.5 had major performance improvement that reduced lock overhead.

* The 3.0 branch will be maintained until 4.0 is released and becomes stable enough (most likely December 2017) 

* I decided to start new version because
    * Some features require format change (external files for large records, extended records)
    * API changes; lot of refactoring
    * changes in core classes (DBMaker, Serializers)
    * Some parts rewritten (Write Ahead Log, Volumes)
    
    
## Major news in 4.0


- Format change in StoreDirect format
    - better support for huge records
    - transparently put large records into external files
        - large records will bypass write-ahead-log, while preserving durability
    - better support for checksums and encryption
    - lazily streaming of large records (right now it is loaded into `byte[]`)   

- full support for zero copy 
    - deserialization input stream reads directly from mmaped file
    - write-ahead-log 
    
    
- redesign Volumes (file IO)
    - refactor File IO to [use memory-mapped files better way](http://www.mapdb.org/blog/mmap_files_alloc_and_jvm_crash/)  
    - support for `AsynchronousFileChannel` and non-blocking disk IO, with continuations and light thread  

- format change
    - support for values in external files
    - unified header 
    - format evolution
        - old features will be deprecated, but not removed
        
- way more automated tests
    - backward compatibility, format spec will be part of tests
- MapDB will integrate with several libraries
    - it will be able to export/import data to Hadoop file formats, Spark... 
    - I do not like several tiny maven project, so everything will be in MapDB artifacts (or perhaps mapdb-extra)
        - in separate package, latter might move into separate jar files
    - MapDB artifact will depend on several libraries, 
        - but those will be optional compile time deps
        - user will be responsible for providing those 
    
- integration with libs and extras

- mapdb will unify various types of collections 
    - spark like
    - chronicle like
    - primitive collections over flat arrays (or memory mapped files)
    - flat cols over mmap files

- support for Streams and Parallel Streams


## Changes in development

-  I kept too tight grip on MapDB, tried to make it perfect, that made development too slow
    - [Lessons from mapdb development blogpost](http://www.mapdb.org/blog/mapdb_lessons/) 
    - in future I will move faster, but keep quality where it matters; automated unit and acceptance tests

- way more blog posts
    - comments on various projects, algorithms, papers 
    - staging place for documentation, 
        - new feature will be first documented in blog post for comments, then moved into separate chapter

- youtube channel
    - screencast videos to walkthrough code in IDE (very fast to produce, good for quick introduction) 
    
- change in a way documentation is made
    - bullet point oriented format
        - very fast to make, very readable
        - Antirez from Redis originally used this format
        - contributors are welcomed to reedit and polish the documentation 
    - more code oriented 
        - code examples will be written first, before code
        
    
- change in release cycle
    - MapDB4 is the last major release
    - various formats will be introduced, and deprecated, but never removed
    - new formats (or collections)  will start new file header, and use different implementations
    - new minor (4.X) version will be out every month
    - integration tests take about week to finish
        - dedicated machine will run integration tests  nonstop 
        - so every week there will be stable snapshot release or minor (4.0.X) bugfix release    

- changes in unit tests
    - way more unit tests 
    - test full matrix of all configuration options; CPU is cheap
    - concurrency stress tests
    - performance regression testing (MapDB 3 release was disaster)
    - test storage format compatibility (can read and modify files generated by older 4.0.0 release)


## Roadmap for next 3 months

- first priority is to finish Elsa Serialization library, but final version will be released together with MapDB 4

- MapDB 4.0 should be out at end of October
    - with features of MapDB 3, but without open TODOs (missing compaction)
  
- there will be many blog post describing my progress on MapDB 

- semi-stable release (passes acceptance tests) should be out every week

    

## New features after 4.0 release

I have very long list of ideas. So I will go through my bookmarks and notes; and put everything into series of blog posts. 

So far most requested features are:

- extra collections to support cryptography and blockchain applications
    - authenticated merkle tree (immutable, fast creation with data pump)
    - authenticated skip list, already written for iodb

- LSM Store based on IODB
    - supports snapshots
    - supports branching (the same way Git or other CVS)
    
- data pump for everything
    - including hashmap
    - fast creation is important for Merge algos
    
- spark compatibility
    - spark data frames is functional data transformation language
        - it also defines how data should be partioned to fit into memory on single node
    - spark uses several nodes
    - but single node spark swaps data in-out of memory
    - mapdb can do it way more efficiently (10x?)
    - so I want to have some compatibility with Spark Data Frames

- Query planner support
    - support some sort SQLish language with query planner and executor
    - take inspiration from Postgres extension API
    - SQL engine from SQLite VM?
    - use Spark Catalyst??    
    
- reactive support
    - planned for very long time 
        I played with Kilim in 2008, JDBM3 was originally steered this direction
    - based on Kotlin continuations and perhaps similar framework
    - based on `AsynchronousFileChannel`
    - non-blocking disk IO
    - should include MapDB and most of its collections
    - support for Akka, RxJava and similar frameworks

- time series database
    
- graph database...

No pressure of course but wondering what are the current plans for 4.0 release. Some features like non-blocking IO are very sweet but github shows only 1 issue in closed for 4.0 and about 60 opened.
